# Marvel ####

#' Multilevel two-mode affiliation, signed one-mode networks of Marvel comic 
#' book characters (Yüksel 2017)
#'
#' @details
#' This package includes two datasets related to the Marvel _comic book_ universe.
#' The first, `ison_marvel_teams`,  is a two-mode affiliation network of 53
#' Marvel comic book characters and their affiliations to 141 different teams.
#' This network includes only information about nodes' names and nodeset,
#' but additional nodal data can be taken from the other Marvel dataset here.
#' 
#' The second network, `ison_marvel_relationships`, is a one-mode signed network
#' of friendships and enmities between the 53 Marvel comic book characters.
#' Friendships are indicated by a positive sign in the edge `sign` attribute,
#' whereas enmities are indicated by a negative sign in this edge attribute.
#' Additional nodal variables have been coded and included by Dr Umut Yüksel:
#' 
#' - **Gender**: binary character, 43 "Male" and 10 "Female"
#' - **PowerOrigin**: binary character, 2 "Alien", 1 "Cyborg", 5 "God/Eternal",
#' 22 "Human", 1 "Infection", 16 "Mutant", 5 "Radiation", 1 "Robot"
#' - **Appearances**: integer, in how many comic book issues they appeared in
#' - **Attractive**: binary integer, 41 1 (yes) and 12 0 (no)
#' - **Rich**: binary integer, 11 1 (yes) and 42 0 (no)
#' - **Intellect**: binary integer, 39 1 (yes) and 14 0 (no)
#' - **Omnilingual**: binary integer, 8 1 (yes) and 45 0 (no)
#' - **UnarmedCombat**: binary integer, 51 1 (yes) and 2 0 (no)
#' - **ArmedCombat**: binary integer, 25 1 (yes) and 28 0 (no)

# Algebra ####

#' Multiplex graph object of friends, social, and task ties (McFarland 2001)
#' 
#' @details Multiplex graph object of friends, social, and task ties between 16 #' anonymous students. 
#' M182 was an honors algebra class where researchers
#' collected friendship, social, and task ties between 16 students.
#' The edge attribute `friends` contains friendship ties,
#' where `2` = best friends, `1` = friend, and `0` is not a friend.
#' `social` consists of social interactions per hour,
#' and `tasks` consists of task interactions per hour.

# Karateka ####

#' One-mode karateka network (Zachary 1977)
#' 
#' @details Zachary's karateka network. The network was observed in a
#' university Karate club in 1977. The network describes association patterns
#' among 34 members and maps out allegiance patterns between members and either
#' Mr. Hi, the instructor, or the John A. the club president after an argument
#' about hiking the price for lessons. The allegiance of each node is
#' listed in the `obc` argument which takes the value 1 if the individual
#' sided with Mr. Hi after the fight and 2 if the individual sided with John A.

# Networkers ####

#' One-mode EIES dataset (Freeman and Freeman 1979)
#'
#' @description A directed, simple, named, weighted graph with 32 nodes and 440
#' edges. Nodes are academics and edges illustrate the communication patterns
#' on an Electronic Information Exchange System among them. Node attributes
#' include the number of citations (`Citations`) and the discipline of the
#' researchers (`Discipline`). Edge weights illustrate the number of emails
#' sent from one academic to another over the studied time period.
