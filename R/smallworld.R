#' Watts-Strogatz small-world model for two-mode networks
#' 
#' Calculates small-world metrics for two-mode networks
#' @param object A matrix, igraph graph, or tidygraph object
#' @param n Number of simulations
#' @family two-mode measures
#' @family node-level measures
#' @return Returns a table of small-world related metrics for each second-mode node.
#' @details The first column of the returned table is simply the number of the second-mode column.
#' The next three columns report the observed and expected clustering, 
#' and the ratio of the former to the later.
#' The next three columns report the observed and expected path-length,
#' and the ratio of the former to the later.
#' The last column reports the ratio of the observed/expected clustering ratio
#' to the observed/expected path-length ratio, which is known as a small-world metric.
#' Expected clustering and paths is the mean of twomode_clustering and mean_distance
#' over 100 random simulations with the same row and column sums.
