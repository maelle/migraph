#' Functions to play games on networks
#' @inheritParams is
#' @param seeds A valid mark vector the length of the
#'   number of nodes in the network.
#' @param thresholds A numeric vector indicating the thresholds
#'   each node has. By default 1.
#'   If less than 1, the threshold is interpreted as complex,
#'   where the threshold concerns the proportion of contacts.
#' @param transmissibility A proportion indicating the transmission rate,
#'   \eqn{\beta}.
#'   By default 1, which means any node for which the threshold is met
#'   or exceeded will become infected.
#'   Anything lower means a correspondingly lower probability of adoption,
#'   even when the threshold is met or exceeded.
#' @param recovery A proportion indicating the rate of recovery, 
#'   \eqn{\gamma}.
#'   For example, if infected individuals take, on average, 
#'   four days to recover, then \eqn{\gamma = 0.25}.
#'   By default 0, which means there is no recovery (i.e. an SI model).
#'   Anything higher results in an SIR model.
#' @param latency A proportion indicating the rate at which those exposed 
#'   become infectious (infected), \eqn{\sigma}.
#'   For example, if exposed individuals take, on average, 
#'   four days to become infectious, then \eqn{\sigma = 0.25}.
#'   By default 0, which means those exposed become immediately infectious (i.e. an SI model).
#'   Anything higher results in e.g. a SEI model.
#' @param waning A proportion indicating the rate at which those who are
#'   recovered become susceptible again, \eqn{\xi}.
#'   For example, if recovered individuals take, on average,
#'   four days to lose their immunity, then \eqn{\xi = 0.25}.
#'   By default 0, which means any recovered individuals retain lifelong immunity (i.e. an SIR model).
#'   Anything higher results in e.g. a SIRS model.
#'   \eqn{\xi = 1} would mean there is no period of immunity, e.g. an SIS model.
#' @param immune A logical or numeric vector identifying nodes
#'   that begin the diffusion process as already recovered.
#'   This could be interpreted as those who are vaccinated or equivalent.
#'   Note however that a waning parameter will affect these nodes too.
#'   By default NULL, indicating that no nodes begin immune.
#' @param steps The number of steps forward in the diffusion to play.
#'   By default the number of nodes in the network.
#'   If `steps = Inf` then the diffusion process will continue until
#'   there are no new infections or all nodes are infected.
