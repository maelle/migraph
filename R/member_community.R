#' @describeIn community A hierarchical, agglomerative algorithm based on random walks.
#' @section Walktrap:
#'   The general idea is that random walks on a network are more likely to stay 
#'   within the same community because few edges lead outside a community.
#'   By repeating random walks of 4 steps many times,
#'   information about the hierarchical merging of communities is collected.
#' @param times Integer indicating number of simulations/walks used.
#'   By default, `times=50`.
#' @examples
#' node_walktrap(ison_adolescents)
#' @export
node_walktrap <- function(.data, times = 50){
  out <- igraph::cluster_walktrap(manynet::as_igraph(.data), 
                           steps=times)$membership

#' @describeIn community A hierarchical, decomposition algorithm
#'   where edges are removed in decreasing order of the number of
#'   shortest paths passing through the edge,
#'   resulting in a hierarchical representation of group membership.
#' @section Edge-betweenness:
#'   This is motivated by the idea that edges connecting different groups 
#'   are more likely to lie on multiple shortest paths when they are the 
#'   only option to go from one group to another. 
#'   This method yields good results but is very slow because of 
#'   the computational complexity of edge-betweenness calculations and 
#'   the betweenness scores have to be re-calculated after every edge removal. 
#'   Networks of ~700 nodes and ~3500 ties are around the upper size limit 
#'   that are feasible with this approach. 
#' @examples
#' node_edge_betweenness(ison_adolescents)
#' @export
node_edge_betweenness <- function(.data){
  out <- igraph::cluster_edge_betweenness(manynet::as_igraph(.data)

#' @describeIn community A hierarchical, agglomerative algorithm, 
#'   that tries to optimize modularity in a greedy manner.
#' @section Fast-greedy:
#'   Initially, each node is assigned a separate community.
#'   Communities are then merged iteratively such that each merge
#'   yields the largest increase in the current value of modularity,
#'   until no further increases to the modularity are possible.
#'   The method is fast and recommended as a first approximation 
#'   because it has no parameters to tune. 
#'   However, it is known to suffer from a resolution limit.
#' @examples
#' node_fast_greedy(ison_adolescents)
#' @export

  out <- igraph::cluster_fast_greedy(manynet::as_igraph(.data)
