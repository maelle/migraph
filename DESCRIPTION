Package: migraph
Title: Multimodal and Multilevel Network Analysis
Version: 0.9.0
Date: 2022-02-28
Description: A set of tools that extend common social network analysis packages
   for analysing multimodal and multilevel networks.
   It includes functions for one- and two-mode (and sometimes three-mode) 
   centrality, centralization, clustering, and constraint,
   as well as for one- and two-mode network regression and block-modelling.
   All functions operate with matrices, edge lists, 
   and 'igraph', 'network'/'sna', and 'tidygraph' objects.
   The package is released as a complement to 
   'Multimodal Political Networks' (2021, ISBN:9781108985000),
   and includes various datasets used in the book.
