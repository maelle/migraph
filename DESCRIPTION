Package: manynet
Title: Many Network Analysis and Visualisation Tools
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2023-01-24
Description: A set of tools for analysing many different types of networks.
   All functions operate with matrices, edge lists, 
   and 'igraph', 'network', and 'tidygraph' objects,
   weighted and signed networks,
   as well as one-mode, two-mode (bipartite), and sometimes three-mode networks.
   It includes functions for measuring 
   centrality, centralization, cohesion, closure, and constraint,
   as well as for network block-modelling, regression, and diffusion models.
   The package is released as a complement to 
   'Multimodal Political Networks' (2021, ISBN:9781108985000),
   and includes datasets used in the book and other network data often used
   for teaching.
   The package includes a broad range of tutorials for networks courses.
