# Setting up

For this lab, we'll explore a couple of different datasets.
First, let's examine heterogeneity within the Marvel relationships dataset.
Since this is a signed network, let's first extract just the friendships.
We'll also concentrate on just the main component (no isolates).
And, for the sake of simplicity, just the characters that appear
in the comics more than average for these characters.

```{r setup}
library(migraph)
marvel_friends <- to_unsigned(ison_marvel_relationships, keep = "positive")
marvel_friends <- to_main_component(marvel_friends)
marvel_friends <- marvel_friends %>% filter(Appearances >= mean(Appearances))
marvel_friends
```

This gives us a dataset of nearly twenty characters and a little more than 100 edges.
Recall that this data has several nodal attributes.
Let's explore a couple of these attributes visually.

```{r vis}
autographr(marvel_friends, 
           node_shape = "Gender",
           node_color = "PowerOrigin")
```

There seems to be a bit of a distribution of some of these variables.

# Calculating diversity

## Calculating Blau index

We can begin by calculating the Blau diversity for each attribute.
Recall that the Blau index for any given diversity variable is:

$$1 - \sum p_i^2$$

where $p$ represents the proportion belonging to any given category,
and $i$ indexes each of the given categories.
As such a perfectly homogeneous group would receive a score of 0,
while a perfectly heterogeneous group (with members spread evenly over the maximum categories)
would receive a score of 1.

```{r blau}
graph_blau_index(marvel_friends, "Gender")
graph_blau_index(marvel_friends, "PowerOrigin")
graph_blau_index(marvel_friends, "Attractive")
graph_blau_index(marvel_friends, "Rich")
graph_blau_index(marvel_friends, "Intellect")
```

Looks like there is more diversity in terms of where these characters got
their powers, whether they have significant intellectual powers,
and their gender, than their attractiveness or their wealth.

We can also cross-reference this diversity.
For example, we might be interested in whether our comic book heroes
are equally gender diverse across their (power) origin stories,
or equally intellectually diverse across gender.^[Note that this works for calculated categorical variables too, such as cluster/group assignment from community detection or equivalence classes.]

```{r crossref}
graph_blau_index(marvel_friends, "Gender", "PowerOrigin")
graph_blau_index(marvel_friends, "Intellect", "Gender")
```

Looks like some origin stories are much more diverse than others.
Gods (just Thor here) and humans are all men,
whereas those with mutant or radiation origin stories are more gender diverse.
There doesn't seem to be any significant difference in intellect 
across gender categories however.
We can visualise this quite effectively using the `node_groups` argument:

```{r blaugroups}
autographr(marvel_friends, 
           node_group = "PowerOrigin", 
           node_shape = "Gender")
autographr(marvel_friends, 
           node_group = "Gender", 
           node_shape = "Intellect")
```

## Calculating EI index

Calculating the EI index follows the same syntax.
Recall that the EI index is calculated as:

$$\frac{E-I}{E+I}$$

where $E$ is the number of ties present between a variable's categories (i.e. external),
and $I$ is the number of ties present within a variable's categories (i.e. internal).
As such, an EI index of -1 suggests perfect homophily, whereas an EI index of +1 suggests perfect heterophily.

```{r ei}
(obs.gender <- graph_ei_index(marvel_friends, "Gender"))
(obs.powers <- graph_ei_index(marvel_friends, "PowerOrigin")) 
(obs.attract <- graph_ei_index(marvel_friends, "Attractive")) 
```

Looks like there might be some gender homophily present,
but the score for power origin homophily is so close to 0 that
it does not seem to signal much.
There seems to be a fairly large effect for homophily on the basis of looks though...

But ultimately these are just scores,
and this doesn't tell us whether this is any more or less than
what we might expect the score to be by chance for a network
of this size and density and distribution of that attribute.

# Testing scores

## Conditional uniform graph tests

To get at that, we will simulate a series of random graphs
(ErdÃ¶s-Renyi/Bernoulli) of the same dimensions and
distribution of the attribute to find out whether there is
more homophily or heterophily than expected by chance.

```{r rando}
(rand.gender <- test_random(marvel_friends, graph_ei_index, attribute = "Gender"))
(rand.power <- test_random(marvel_friends, graph_ei_index, attribute = "PowerOrigin"))
(rand.attract <- test_random(marvel_friends, graph_ei_index, attribute = "Attractive"))
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(rand.gender)
plot(rand.power)
plot(rand.attract)
```

This is really interesting.
It looks like we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no homophily
for gender nor for attractiveness,
but we can reject the null hypothesis with respect to their power origin story.
While the effect itself is close to 0 (neither strong homophily nor heterophily),
all the random networks generated returned larger EI scores, between .1 and .4.
So there is significantly less heterophily here than expected.

## Quadratic assignment procedure tests

But perhaps the random graph is not the best reference group for establishing whether
there is a significant homophily effect here.
Another approach is to use permutations of the network.
Permuting the network retains the structure of the network, 
but reassigns any labels (variables) randomly.
Let's first plot the observed data and some permuted data next to each other.

```{r perm}
old <- autographr(marvel_friends, 
                  labels = FALSE, node_size = 6, 
                  node_color = "PowerOrigin", 
                  node_shape = "Gender")
new <- autographr(generate_permutation(marvel_friends),
                   labels = FALSE, node_size = 6,
                  node_color = "PowerOrigin",
                  node_shape = "Gender")
grid.arrange(old, new)
```

This single permutation suggests there might otherwise be some more even mixing of these
attributes, but it is just a single permutation.
Let's try a test that runs this over a succession of permutations,
just as we did with random graphs.

```{r test_permute}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
perm.gender <- test_permutation(marvel_friends, graph_ei_index, attribute = "Gender")
plot(perm.gender) # Sorry the labelling on this is not right yet, will fix this next...
perm.power <- test_permutation(marvel_friends, graph_ei_index, attribute = "PowerOrigin")
plot(perm.power)
```

Again, we see that there is perhaps nothing so surprising that we got the homophily score
for gender that we did, but the lack of power origin heterophily is surprising.

```{r cugqap}
plot(rand.gender)
plot(rand.power)
plot(perm.gender)
plot(perm.power)
```

Note how distributions are generally wider when permuting the observed network 
than creating a random distribution.
That is, we expect a larger spread in the EI index for a network of this structure.
