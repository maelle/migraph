## Making

- Moved to @describeIn documentation (closed #215)

- `autographr()` now incorporates `ggidentify()` functionality (closed #150)
- `{patchwork}` is now used to assemble multiple plots together

## Measures

- Added new `measure` class and directed most `node_*()` functions to create objects of this class

## Motifs

- Added some guidance to the naming convention used in `node_quad_census()`

## Models

- Extended `network_reg()`'s formula-based system
  - `network_reg()` can now handle binary and multiple categorical variables (factors and characters, closed #211); 
  - `network_reg()` can now manage interactions specified in the common syntax; `var1 * var2` expands to `var1 + var2 + var1:var2` (closed #163)
  - `dist()` and `sim()` effects have been added (closed #207)
- `network_reg()` now employs logistic regression to estimate a binary outcome and linear regression to estimate a continuous outcome (closed #184)
- `network_reg()` now uses Dekker et al's semi-partialling procedure by default for multivariate specifications (closed #206), defaulting to _y_-permutations in the case of a single predictor (closed #208)

  - Refactored `network_reg()`, relying on `{furrr}` for potential parallelisation and `{progressr}` for progress reports (closed #185, #186)

- Added plot method for `cug_test` and `qap_test` class objects, which plots the empirical distribution, highlighting tails beyond some critical value (closed #213), and superimposing the observed coefficient and, possibly, 0
- Relabelled some classes to avoid loading conflicts with `{sna}`

  - `plot.block_model()` replaces `plot.blockmodel()`
