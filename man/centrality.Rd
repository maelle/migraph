\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of a migraph-consistent class:
\itemize{
\item matrix, from base R
\item edgelist, a data frame from base R or tibble from tibble
\item igraph, from the igraph package
\item network, from the network package
\item tbl_graph, from the tidygraph package
}}

\item{normalized}{Logical scalar, whether the centrality scores are normalized.
Different denominators are used depending on whether the object is one-mode or two-mode,
the type of centrality, and other arguments.}

\item{direction}{Character string, “out” bases the measure on outgoing ties,
“in” on incoming ties, and "all" on either/the sum of the two.
For two-mode networks, "all" uses as numerator the sum of differences
between the maximum centrality score for the mode
against all other centrality scores in the network,
whereas "in" uses as numerator the sum of differences
between the maximum centrality score for the mode
against only the centrality scores of the other nodes in that mode.}

\item{cutoff}{Maximum path length to use during calculations.}

\item{scale}{Logical scalar, whether to rescale the vector so the maximum score is 1.}
}
\value{
A single centralization score if the object was one-mode,
and two centralization scores if the object was two-mode.

Depending on how and what kind of an object is passed to the function,
the function will return a \code{tidygraph} object where the nodes have been updated

A numeric vector giving the betweenness centrality measure of each node.

A numeric vector giving the eigenvector centrality measure of each node.

\description{
These functions calculate common centrality measures for one- and two-mode networks.
All measures attempt to use as much information as they are offered,
including whether the networks are directed, weighted, or multimodal.
If this would produce unintended results,
first transform the salient properties using e.g. \code{\link[=to_undirected]{to_undirected()}} functions.
All centrality and centralization measures return normalized measures by default,
including for two-mode networks.
