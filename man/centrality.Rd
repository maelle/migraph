\arguments{
\item{object}{Either an igraph graph object or a matrix.}

\item{weights}{The weight of the edges to use for the calculation.
Will be evaluated in the context of the edge data.}

\item{mode}{How should edges be followed (in or out). By default, outdegree of
the node is calculated. Ignored for undirected graphs.}

\item{loops}{Should loops be included in the calculation}

\item{normalized}{For one-mode networks, should Borgatti and Everett normalization be applied?}

\item{cutoff}{maximum path length to use during calculations}

\item{directed}{Should direction of edges be used for the calculations}

\item{nobigint}{Should big integers be avoided during calculations}

\item{options}{Settings passed on to \code{igraph::arpack()}}

\item{scale}{Should the scores be scaled to range between 0 and 1?}
}
\value{
Depending on how and what kind of an object is passed to the function,
the function will return a \code{tidygraph} object where the nodes have been updated

A numeric vector giving the betweenness centrality measure of each node.

A numeric vector giving the eigenvector centrality measure of each node.
}
\description{
These functions calculate common centrality measures for both one- and two-mode networks.
They accept as objects matrices and \code{igraph} graphs,
and can be used within a tidygraph workflow.
Importantly, these functions also offer correct normalization for two-mode networks.
