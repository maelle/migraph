\title{Clustering for one-, two-, and three- mode networks}
\usage{
graph_clustering(object, object2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A one-mode or two-mode matrix, igraph, or tidygraph}

\item{object2}{Optionally, a second (two-mode) matrix, igraph, or tidygraph}
}
\description{
This function offers clustering methods for one-, two-, and three-mode networks.
}
\details{
For one-mode networks, the function serves as a shallow wrapper for \code{igraph::transitivity},
since global transitivity is a regular measure for clustering or local density in one-mode networks.

For two-mode networks, we calculate the proportion of three-paths in the network
that are closed by fourth tie to establish a "shared four-cycle" structure.

For three-mode networks, we calculate the proportion of three-paths spanning the two two-mode networks
that are closed by a fourth tie to establish a "congruent four-cycle" structure.
