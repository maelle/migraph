\title{Identify nodes and edges based on some criteria}
\usage{
edge_multiple(object)

edge_loop(object)

edge_reciprocal(object)

edge_bridges(object)

node_cuts(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of a migraph-consistent class:
\itemize{
\item matrix, from base R
\item edgelist, a data frame from base R or tibble from tibble
\item igraph, from the igraph package
\item network, from the network package
\item tbl_graph, from the tidygraph package
}}
}
\description{
These functions return logical vectors of the length of the
nodes or edges in a network that identify nodes or edges that
meet some criteria.
Such functions are often useful for identifying particular
nodes or edges that are particularly well- or poorly-connected.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{edge_multiple}: Returns logical of which edges are multiples

\item \code{edge_loop}: Returns logical of which edges are loops

\item \code{edge_reciprocal}: Returns logical of which edges
are mutual/reciprocated

\item \code{edge_bridges}: Returns logical of which nodes cut
or act as articulation points in a network.

\item \code{node_cuts}: Returns logical of which nodes cut
or act as articulation points in a network,
increasing the number of connected components in a graph when removed.
