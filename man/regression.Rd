\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula describing the relationship being tested.
Several additional terms are available to assist users investigate
the effects they are interested in. These include:
\itemize{
\item \code{ego()} constructs a matrix where the cells reflect the value of
a named nodal attribute for an edge's sending node
\item \code{alter()} constructs a matrix where the cells reflect the value of
a named nodal attribute for an edge's receiving node
\item \code{same()} constructs a matrix where a 1 reflects
if two nodes' attribute values are the same
\item \code{dist()} constructs a matrix where the cells reflect the
absolute difference between the attribute's values
for the sending and receiving nodes
\item \code{sim()} constructs a matrix where the cells reflect the
proportional similarity between the attribute's values
for the sending and receiving nodes
\item dyadic covariates (other networks) can just be named
}}

\item{data}{An igraph, network, or tidygraph object.}

\item{method}{A method for establishing the null hypothesis.
Note that "qap" uses Dekker et al's (2007) double semi-partialling technique,
whereas "qapy" permutes only the $y$ variable.
"qap" is the default.}

\item{times}{Integer indicating the number of draws to use for quantile
estimation. (Relevant to the null hypothesis test only - the analysis
itself is unaffected by this parameter.)
Note that, as for all Monte Carlo procedures, convergence is slower for more
extreme quantiles.
By default, times=1000.
1,000 - 10,000 repetitions recommended for publication-ready results.}

\item{strategy}{If \code{{furrr}} is installed,
then multiple cores can be used to accelerate the function.
By default \code{"sequential"},
but if multiple cores available,
then \code{"multisession"} or \code{"multicore"} may be useful.
Generally this is useful only when \code{times} > 1000.
See \code{\link{furrr}} for more.}

\item{verbose}{Whether the function should report on its progress.
By default FALSE.
See \code{\link{progressr}} for more.}
}
\description{
This function provides an implementation of
the multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure (MRQAP)
for both one-mode and two-mode network linear models.
It offers several advantages:
\itemize{
\item it works with combined graph/network objects such as igraph and network objects
by constructing the various dependent and independent matrices for the user.
\item it uses a more intuitive formula-based system for specifying the model,
with several ways to specify how nodal attributes should be handled.
\item it can handle categorical variables (factors/characters) and
interactions intuitively.
\item it relies on \code{\link{furrr}} for parallelising
and \code{\link{progressr}} for reporting progress to the user,
which can be useful when many simulations are required.
\item results are \code{\link{tidymodel}}-compatible,
with \code{tidy()} and \code{glance()} reports to facilitate comparison
with results from different models.
Note that a t- or z-value is always used as the test statistic,
and properties of the dependent network
-- modes, directedness, loops, etc --
will always be respected in permutations and analysis.
