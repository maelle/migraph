\usage{
layout_tbl_graph_hierarchy(object, circular = FALSE, times = 1000)

layout_tbl_graph_railway(object, circular = FALSE, times = 1000)

layout_tbl_graph_concentric(
  object,
  membership = NULL,
  radius = NULL,
  order.by = NULL,
  circular = FALSE,
  times = 1000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of a migraph-consistent class:
\itemize{
\item matrix (adjacency or incidence) from \code{{base}} R
\item edgelist, a data frame from \code{{base}} R or tibble from \code{{tibble}}
\item igraph, from the \code{{igraph}} package
\item network, from the \code{{network}} package
\item tbl_graph, from the \code{{tidygraph}} package
}}

\item{membership}{A vector of partition memberships.}

\item{radius}{A vector of radii at which the concentric circles
should be located.
By default this is equal placement around an empty centre,
unless one (the core) is a single node,
in which case this node occupies the centre of the graph.}

\item{order.by}{An attribute label indicating the (decreasing) order
for the nodes around the circles.
By default ordering is given by a bipartite placement that reduces
the number of edge crossings.}
