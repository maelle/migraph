\title{Cohesion for one-, two-, and three- mode networks}
\usage{
graph_density(object)

graph_reciprocity(object, method = "default")

graph_transitivity(object)

graph_equivalency(object)

graph_congruency(object, object2)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A one-mode or two-mode matrix, igraph, or tidygraph}

\item{method}{For reciprocity, either \code{default} or \code{ratio}.
See \code{?igraph::reciprocity}}

\item{object2}{Optionally, a second (two-mode) matrix, igraph, or tidygraph}
}
\description{
These functions offer methods for summarising the cohesion in one-, two-, and three-mode networks.
}
\details{
For one- and two-mode networks, \code{graph_density} summarises the ratio of ties
to the number of possible ties.

For one-mode networks, shallow wrappers of igraph versions exist via
\code{graph_reciprocity} and \code{graph_transitivity}.

For two-mode networks, \code{graph_equivalency} calculates the proportion of three-paths in the network
that are closed by fourth tie to establish a "shared four-cycle" structure.

For three-mode networks, \code{graph_congruency} calculates the proportion of three-paths spanning the two two-mode networks
that are closed by a fourth tie to establish a "congruent four-cycle" structure.
