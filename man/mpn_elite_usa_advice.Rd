\description{
A 2-mode network of persons serving as directors or trustees of think tanks.
Think tanks are “public-policy research analysis and engagement organizations
that generate policy-oriented research, analysis, and advice on domestic and international issues,
thereby enabling policymakers and the public to make informed decisions about public policy” (McGann 2016: 6).
The Power Elite Database (Domhoff 2016) includes information on the directors of 33 prominent think tanks in 2012.
Here we include only 14 directors who held three or more seats among 20 think tanks.
