\description{
This data contains the full network of 35 members of the Mexican power elite.
The undirected lines connecting pairs of men represent any formal, informal,
or organizational relation between a dyad;
for example, “common belonging (school, sports, business, political participation),
or a common interest (political power)” (Mendieta et al. 1997: 37).
Additional nodal attributes include their full name, place of birth, state,
and region (1=North, 2=Centre, 3=South, original coding added by
\href{https://jameshollway.com/courses/ison/heber_post}{Frank Heber}),
as well as their year of entry into politics
and whether they are civilian (0) or affiliated with the military (1).
An additional variable "in_mpn" can be used to subset this network
to a network of 11 core members of the 1990s Mexican power elite (Knoke 2017),
three of which were successively elected presidents of Mexico:
José López Portillo (1976-82), Miguel de la Madrid (1982-88), and Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988-94,
who was also the son of another core member, Raúl Salinas Lozano).
