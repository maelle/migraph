  - title: "Making"
    desc: |
      Functions for constructing, simulating, and importing
      one-mode and two-mode networks:
    contents:
      - starts_with("create_")
      - starts_with("generate_")
      - starts_with("read")
      - starts_with("write")
  - title: "Manipulation"
    desc: |
      Functions for coercing objects between different classes, 
      reformatting or transforming the type of network,
      or adding information to or retrieving information from the network.
    contents:
      - starts_with("as_")
      - starts_with("to_")
      - add
      - grab
  - title: "Marks"
    desc: |
      Functions for identifying properties of graphs, nodes or ties,
      all returning logical scalars or vectors.
      Note that all `node_` and `tie_` measures return a single vector
      so that they can be added directly to graph objects.
      `graph_` measures return one or, in some cases of two-mode measures,
      two values.
    contents:
      - contains("is_")
  - title: "Measures"
    desc: |
      Functions for measuring multimodal networks,
      all returning numeric scalars or vectors.
      Note that all `node_` and `tie_` measures return a single vector
      so that they can be added directly to graph objects.
      `graph_` measures return one or, in some cases of two-mode measures,
      two values.
    contents:
      - cohesion
      - centrality
      - centralisation
      - closure
      - holes
      - diversity
      - features
  - title: "Motifs"
    desc: |
      Functions for calculating subgraphs in multimodal networks.
      These functions have an additional dimension than `node_` and `graph_`
      measures and marks that capture the different motifs surveyed.
    contents:
      - ends_with("_census")
  - title: "Memberships"
    desc: |
      Functions for identifying community, cluster, or class memberships
      in partitions within multimodal networks.
      They return integer vectors the length of the nodes in the network.
    contents:
      - community
      - components
      - equivalence
      - core-periphery
  - title: "Models"

  - title: "Data"
    desc: |
      The package contains two collections of multimodal, multilevel, and multiplex network data,
      including data used in the book _Multimodal Political Networks_ (prefixed with `mpn_`)
      and for the course 'Social Networks Theories and Methods' (`ison_`).
    contents:
      - starts_with("mpn_")
      - starts_with("ison_")
