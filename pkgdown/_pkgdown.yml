      Functions for coercing objects between different classes, 
      testing the properties of migraph-consistent objects,
      and transforming the type of network:

  - title: "Measures"
    desc: |
      Functions for measuring multimodal networks.
      Note that all `node_` measures return a single vector so that
      they can be added directly to graph objects,
      though two-mode results will be printed in two sections
      All `graph_` measures return a single value.
    contents:
      - centrality
      - cohesion
      - diversity
      - node_constraint
      - graph_smallworld
      - graph_components

      Functions for identifying class, cluster, or partition memberships 
      in multimodal networks.

  - title: "Data"
    desc: |
      The package contains two collections of multimodal, multilevel, and multiplex network data,
      including data used in the book _Multimodal Political Networks_ (prefixed with `mpn_`)
      and for the course 'Social Networks Theories and Methods' (`ison_`).
    contents:
      - starts_with("mpn_")
      - starts_with("ison_")
